# Insurance-Cost-Analysis-Mini-Project
Insurance Cost Analysis Using Machine Learning
Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze an insurance cost dataset to understand the factors that affect annual medical insurance charges and to build machine learning regression models for cost prediction.
This project was completed as part of my learning during the IBM Data Science / IBM Data Analyst course. This project is a learning-based mini project created to strengthen my understanding of data science workflows.

Project Overview
In this project, I worked on an insurance dataset to apply concepts of:
Data analysis
Data cleaning
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Feature impact analysis
Regression modeling
Model refinement using regularization

Dataset Information :- Dataset Source: IBM Data Science / IBM Data Analyst Course ,  Dataset Type: Insurance Cost Datasetand  Dataset Availability: Not included in this repository
The dataset used in this project was provided by IBM only for educational purposes as part of their course content. Due to this reason, the dataset cannot be shared publicly on GitHub.This code  can run the code using any similar insurance dataset with the same column structure.

Dataset Description
Parameter	Description	Data Type
age	Age of the insured person (years)	Integer
gender	Gender (1 = Male, 2 = Female)	Integer
bmi	Body Mass Index	Float
no_of_children	Number of children	Integer
smoker	Smoking status (0 = No, 1 = Yes)	Integer
region	US region (1 = NW, 2 = NE, 3 = SW, 4 = SE)	Integer
charges	Annual medical insurance charges (USD)	Float

Steps Performed in This Project
1️)Data Loading & Cleaning :-
Loaded dataset into pandas DataFrame
Checked for missing or inconsistent values
Cleaned and prepared data for analysis

2️) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Analyzed distribution of insurance charges
Studied the effect of age, BMI, smoking status, and region
Visualized patterns and trends using graphs

3️) Feature Impact Analysis
Identified features that strongly affect insurance charges
Observed smoking and age as major influencing factors

4️) Model Building
 Single-Variable Linear Regression
Built models using one feature at a time
Understood individual feature impact
 Multi-Variable Linear Regression
Used multiple features together
Improved prediction performance through Ridge Regression (Model Refinement) Applied regularization to reduce overfitting Improved model stability and generalization

Learning Outcome
Through this project, I learned:
How insurance data is analyzed in real-world scenarios
How regression models are built and evaluated
How to improve models using Ridge Regression
How to present analysis clearly
How to structure and upload a project on GitHub

Project Type
Type: Learning-based Mini Project
